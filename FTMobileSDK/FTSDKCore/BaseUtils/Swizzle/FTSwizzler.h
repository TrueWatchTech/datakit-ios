/**
 Swizzles the instance method of the class with the new implementation.

 Example for swizzling `-(int)calculate:(int)number;` method:

 @code

    FTSwizzlerInstanceMethod(classToSwizzle,
                            @selector(calculate:),
                            FTSWReturnType(int),
                            FTSWArguments(int number),

    {

        int res = FTSWCallOriginal(number);
        // Returning modified return value.
        return res + 1;
    }), 0, NULL);
 
 @endcode
 
 Swizzling frequently goes along with checking whether this particular class (or one of its superclasses) has been already swizzled. Here the `FTSwizzlerMode` and `key` parameters can help. See +[FTSwizzler swizzleInstanceMethod:inClass:newImpFactory:mode:key:] for details.

 Swizzling is fully thread-safe.

 @param classToSwizzle The class with the method that should be swizzled.

 @param selector Selector of the method that should be swizzled.
 
 @param FTSWReturnType The return type of the swizzled method wrapped in the FTSWReturnType macro.
 
 @param FTSWArguments The arguments of the swizzled method wrapped in the FTSWArguments macro.
 
 @param FTSWReplacement The code of the new implementation of the swizzled method wrapped in the FTSWReplacement macro.
 
 @param FTSwizzlerMode The mode is used in combination with the key to indicate whether the swizzling should be done for the given class. You can pass 0 for FTSwizzlerModeAlways.
 
 @param key The key is used in combination with the mode to indicate whether the swizzling should be done for the given class. May be NULL if the mode is FTSwizzlerModeAlways.

 @return YES if successfully swizzled and NO if swizzling has been already done for given key and class (or one of superclasses, depends on the mode).

#pragma mark └ Swizzle Instance Method

/**
 Swizzles the instance method of the class with the new implementation.

 Original implementation must always be called from the new implementation. And because of the the fact that for safe and robust swizzling original implementation must be dynamically fetched at the time of calling and not at the time of swizzling, swizzling API is a little bit complicated.

 You should pass a factory block that returns the block for the new implementation of the swizzled method. And use swizzleInfo argument to retrieve and call original implementation.

 Example for swizzling `-(int)calculate:(int)number;` method:
 
 @code

    SEL selector = @selector(calculate:);
    [FTSwizzler
     swizzleInstanceMethod:selector
     inClass:classToSwizzle
     newImpFactory:^id(FTSwizzlerInfo *swizzleInfo) {
         // This block will be used as the new implementation.
         return ^int(__unsafe_unretained id self, int num){
             // You MUST always cast implementation to the correct function pointer.
             int (*originalIMP)(__unsafe_unretained id, SEL, int);
             originalIMP = (__typeof(originalIMP))[swizzleInfo getOriginalImplementation];
             // Calling original implementation.
             int res = originalIMP(self,selector,num);
             // Returning modified return value.
             return res + 1;
         };

     key:NULL];
 
 @endcode

 Swizzling frequently goes along with checking whether this particular class (or one of its superclasses) has been already swizzled. Here the `mode` and `key` parameters can help.

 Here is an example of swizzling `-(void)dealloc;` only in case when neither class and no one of its superclasses has been already swizzled with our key. However "Deallocating ..." message still may be logged multiple times per method call if swizzling was called primarily for an inherited class and later for one of its superclasses.
 
 @code
 
    static const void *key = &key;
    SEL selector = NSSelectorFromString(@"dealloc");
    [FTSwizzler
     swizzleInstanceMethod:selector
     inClass:classToSwizzle
     newImpFactory:^id(FTSwizzlerInfo *swizzleInfo) {
         return ^void(__unsafe_unretained id self){
             NSLog(@"Deallocating %@.",self);
             
             void (*originalIMP)(__unsafe_unretained id, SEL);
             originalIMP = (__typeof(originalIMP))[swizzleInfo getOriginalImplementation];
